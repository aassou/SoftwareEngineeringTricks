# Open/Closed Principle

The Open/Closed Principle is the O of SOLID principles acronym. 

The OCP is about making an entity open for extension but closed for modification.

This means that if we want to extend a functionality we have to add new code instead of changing existing code.

The directory OpenCloseImplementation, shows how to follow the Open/Closed Principle for better coding.
